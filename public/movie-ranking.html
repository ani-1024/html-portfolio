<h1>Movies that I have seen</h1>

<h2>My favourite movies of last year.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>This is the movie that Christopher Nolan was born to make.</p>

<h3>Jawan</h3>
<p>Nice dumb fun, with much needed social commentary.</p>

<h3>Asteroid City</h3>
<p>Poignant, and an excellent movie on art and how it's made.</p>
